# RNN_model_Twitter_Sentiment

Multi-layer Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for text classification sentiment analysis in Python using TensorFlow.

Twitter.py loads the pre-trained model and classifies the sentiment of tweets contaning given key words using Titter API. 

Tweets are filtered by key words, start date and number of most recent tweets. The script removes @ mentions but retains hastags when preparing the text for classification.
